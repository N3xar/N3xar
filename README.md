- 👋 Hi, I’m @N3xar, I'm from Cape-Town in sunny South Africa
- 👀 I’m interested in Tech - have been providing support for desktops, networks, servers for 20 years now. It isn't just what I do, it's who I am. I'm also an avid gamer, for the love of art and passion that goes into it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github and collaborating on projects through it, in support of a modlist I'm making for Fallout 4, which you can find more info on at https://nexarplays.co.za/fallout4
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything on my Github really, as well as related to my profession (above).
- 📫 How to reach me: message me here on Github - I'll share further contact details from there.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are - Master Oogway (Kung Fu Panda)
